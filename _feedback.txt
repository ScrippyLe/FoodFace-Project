Requirements:
[G] Use Flexbox or Grid system layout for the basic structure of your elements
[R] Be able to navigate to the different pages. For example, clicking on "Login" should bring me to the login page, filling out the information and clicking "login" should then lead me to the dashboard page. Then, clicking "logout" should bring me back to the home page.
